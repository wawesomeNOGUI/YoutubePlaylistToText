# YoutubePlaylistToText
Output all the video names in a youtube playlist in plain text.

*Note*

To get all the names in a long playlist you have to:
- Scroll all the way to the end of the playlist to get youtube to send you all the video names
- Next go into the dev console and inspect one of the video titles to get the div itâ€™s in
  (The farthest div you should have to go will be labled something like: <div id="content" class="style-scope ytd-app">)
- Copy everything inside that div to get all the video titles
- Paste that text into a file and use that file as input when running the program e.g:
main.exe -file pathToFile.html > playListAsText.txt
